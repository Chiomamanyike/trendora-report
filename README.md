## Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
- Total Purchase Amount reached a total of about $233k 
- Average Review Rating by customers was 3.75, which is a fair score.
- There were exactly 3,900 purchases in the year under review.

## Top Products Purchased
- The top 5 out of 25 products purchased were highlighted, which generated a purchase amount of $51K.

## Purchase Quantity by Age Group
- The analysis highlighted that most (89%) of the purchases were made by adults aged 20+ years, generating a purchase amount of $208K.

## Purchases Trend by Season
- The analysis highlighted Fall to be the season with the highest purchase made by customers, accounting for $60K of purchase amount
- It is worth noting that the average purchase amount across all seasons was in the range of $60k to $55k. So, there was no significant drop in the trend of purchases across seasons

## Payment Method and Gender Distribution
- Customer preference for Bank Transfer in terms of the payment method is quite low at 16%. The most preferred payment method is Debit card at 36% due to network issues and delays experienced in the confirmation of payment. This discourages customers from opting for the Bank Transfer payment method.
- There are more female customers (75%) compared to males (25%). There is a significant difference in the distribution of customers by gender.

## Recommendations
- Seeing that there is a low preference for Bank Transfer in terms of the payment method, there is a need to improve network quality and liaise with the banks to ensure faster payment processing and confirmation.
